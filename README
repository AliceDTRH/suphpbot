suphpbot - A modular, non-OOP IRC bot written entirely in PHP
Version 0.1b - http://za.chary.us/ - zbloomq@live.com
=================================================
This is an IRC bot.
=================================================
1. INSTALLATION
=================================================
I highly recommend that you /not/ put this in a web-accessible
location. The bot must be run from a command-line for optimal
performance. Here are the requirements for installation:
	* PHP 5 or higher
	* Access to a shell account on your server
	* Sockets enabled on your PHP installation
That's pretty much it. To get started, first open the ircconfig.ini
file in a text editor such as Notepad or gedit. Change the lines to
match the values you need to connect to your IRC server. 
Information about the various configuration options can be found
within the ircconfig.ini file itself.
NOTE: If you are planning to run this on a web server, ircconfig.ini
can be downloaded by users. I recommend blocking access to it
using .htaccess.
=================================================
2. RUNNING THE BOT
=================================================
To run the bot, open up a shell and navigate to the directory
where you extracted the files to. If you want to run it in the
background as a service, use this command:
	php ./ircbot.php >> /dev/null &
If something is going wrong and you want to run it with verbose
console output, use this command:
	php ./ircbot.php
=================================================
3. GENERAL BOT ADMINISTRATION
=================================================
To identify as an admin to the bot, you must fulfill 2 requirements:
	1) Your nick must be in the 'admin' configuration variable, and
	2) You must be identified to NickServ on your IRC server.
To send a command to the bot, type your command character and
the name of the command next to eachother into a channel in
which the bot is present. For example, if you wanted to ping the bot:
	~ping
[the default command character is ~]
Here is a list of the central core commands:
	* load [module name here] - Loads a phpbot module so its
	commands can be used.
	* unload [module name here] - Unloads a phpbot module from
	the command list.
	* list - Sends a list of the currently available commands.
	* whoami - Tells you who you are.
	* quit - Quits the IRC network and kills the bot.
	* join [channel] - Tells the bot to join a channel.
	* part [channel] - Tells the bot to part from a channel.
